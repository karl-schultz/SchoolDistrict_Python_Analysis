# SchoolDistrict_Python_Analysis
This project uses sample data of school district-wide standardized test results. My analysis uses the pandas library in Python to aggregate and summarize the data to show trends in math and reading scores. At end of analysis we determine the highest performing schools by percentage of students passing math and reading district standards. Download files and run .ipnyb file in Jupyter Notebook from location in folder.
